# PDF-AHK
A simple AutoHotKey script to open a large number of PDF files in sequence with customizable wait time.

This makes use of GUI to open PDFs in default viewer set in your pc. A text file which contains all the pdf file paths is required to open the PDF in sequence, this text file path must be edited in the AHK script.

A secondary python code to collect all the file paths from a specific folder is added for ease (AHK_supporter.py)
